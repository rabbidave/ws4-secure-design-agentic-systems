# Artifact Integrity Maturity Model
## Progressive Security for AI Artifact Provenance

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Framework Alignment:** CoSAI-RM, MITRE ATLAS, OWASP LLM Top 10, SLSA, in-toto

---

## Abstract

AI artifacts (models, training data, configurations) require cryptographic proof of integrity, lineage, and policy compliance. This standard defines a **progressive maturity model** enabling organizations to start with basic integrity and advance to full attestation-based provenance as operational requirements grow.

The model addresses three orthogonal concerns: **claims** (what can be proven), **topology** (how artifacts relate), and **verification** (how proofs are validated).

## The Fundamental Problem

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph traditional["Traditional"]
        T1["Model v1.0"] --> T2["Model v1.1"] --> T3["???"]
    end
    
    subgraph maturity["With Maturity Model"]
        M1["v1.0\n+ hash\n+ signature"] --> M2["v1.1\n+ lineage\n+ inputs verified"] --> M3["v1.2\n+ attestations\n+ policy pass"]
    end
    
    traditional -.->|"What changed?\nWho approved?\nIs it safe?"| maturity
    
    style traditional fill:#ffebee,stroke:#c62828
    style maturity fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
```

**The vulnerability:** Artifacts flow through ML pipelines without cryptographic proof of what they are, where they came from, or whether they're safe to deploy.

**The solution:** Progressive claims that prove integrity (L1), lineage (L2), and policy compliance (L3).

## Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Proves | Topology |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| **1** | Basic Integrity | "This artifact exists, was created by X, and hasn't changed" | Chain |
| **2** | Chaining & Lineage | "This artifact was derived from verified inputs through a documented process" | Chain, Tree |
| **3** | Attestations & Policy | "This artifact meets policy requirements and is approved for deployment" | Chain, Tree, DAG |

## Topology Selection

Organizations select lineage topology based on operational requirements:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph chain["CHAIN (Level 1)"]
        direction LR
        C1["v1.0"] --> C2["v1.1"] --> C3["v1.2"]
    end
    
    subgraph tree["TREE (Level 2)"]
        direction TB
        T1["base"]
        T2["data"]
        T3["config"]
        T4["trained"]
        T1 --> T4
        T2 --> T4
        T3 --> T4
    end
    
    subgraph dag["DAG (Level 3)"]
        direction TB
        D1["base"]
        D2["fork_a"]
        D3["fork_b"]
        D4["merged"]
        D1 --> D2
        D1 --> D3
        D2 --> D4
        D3 --> D4
    end
    
    style chain fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style tree fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2
    style dag fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2
```

| Topology | Max Inputs | Branching | Merging | Verification | Use Case |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Chain** | 1 | ✗ | ✗ | O(n) | Version history |
| **Tree** | ∞ | ✓ | ✗ | O(n) DFS | Training pipelines |
| **DAG** | ∞ | ✓ | ✓ | O(V+E) | Model merging, ensembles |

  algorithm: SHA256
  alternatives: [SHA384, SHA512, SHA3-256]

## Risks & Controls

### Risk: Artifact Tampering (ATLAS: AML.T0048)
**Threat:** Artifact content modified after signing.  
**Control:** INV-L1-01 — Hash verification detects any modification.

### Risk: Lineage Manipulation
**Threat:** False derivation claims or input substitution.  
**Control:** INV-L2-02 — All input hashes verified before derivation.

### Risk: Diamond Inconsistency (DAG only)
**Threat:** Same artifact has different hashes via different paths.  
**Control:** Diamond consistency check during DAG verification.

### Risk: Attestation Forgery (ATLAS: AML.T0043)
**Threat:** False attestations about model performance or data provenance.  
**Control:** INV-L3-01/02/03 — Attestation signatures verified against trusted attesters.

### Risk: Policy Bypass
**Threat:** Deployment without required policy evaluation.  
**Control:** INV-L3-05/06 — Policy evaluation and admission gate required.

## Validation Sequence

### Level 1

```
1. VERIFY signature.algorithm ∈ allowed_algorithms
2. VERIFY signature over canonical manifest              [INV-L1-02]
3. VERIFY signer.subject ∈ trust_store                   [INV-L1-03]
4. VERIFY H(artifact_content) == integrity.digest        [INV-L1-01] ← critical
5. IF timestamp: VERIFY |now() - signed_at| < tolerance  [INV-L1-04]
6. RETURN {measured: ✓, produced_by: ✓, signer_verified: ✓}
```

### Level 2 (extends Level 1)

```
7.  VERIFY chain_position > 0 OR chain_integrity == "GENESIS"
8.  FOR EACH input: VERIFY H(input) == original_digest   [INV-L2-02] ← critical
9.  IF previous: VERIFY H(prev.sig) == prev_sig_hash     [INV-L2-04]
10. IF topology == TREE: VERIFY no_diamonds(graph)
11. IF EVIDENCE_BACKED: VERIFY evidence exists           [INV-L2-03]
12. RETURN L1 + {derived_from: ✓, inputs_verified: ✓, chain_valid: ✓}
```

### Level 3 (extends Level 2)

```
13. IF topology == DAG: VERIFY no_cycles(graph)
14. IF topology == DAG: VERIFY diamond_consistency(graph)
15. VERIFY attestations.process EXISTS + signature       [INV-L3-01]
16. IF type=model: VERIFY attestations.model EXISTS      [INV-L3-02]
17. IF uses_training_data: VERIFY attestations.data      [INV-L3-03]
18. FOR EACH eval: VERIFY result ∈ {PASS, WARN}          [INV-L3-05]
19. IF deploying: VERIFY admitted == true                [INV-L3-06]
20. RETURN L2 + {attested: ✓, policy_passed: ✓, admitted: ✓}
```

## Multi-Party Claim Navigation

When claims come from different parties:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph parties["Different Signing Parties"]
        ALICE["Alice (Producer)\nPRODUCED_BY(X)"]
        BOB["Bob (Consumer)\nINPUT_VERIFIED(X)"]
        CAROL["Carol (Pipeline)\nDERIVED_FROM(Y←X)"]
        DAVE["Dave (ML Validator)\nATTESTED(model, Y)"]
        EVE["Eve (Security)\nATTESTED(infra, Y)"]
    end
    
    subgraph index["Pointer-by-Subject Index"]
        X["claims['X'] = {\n  PRODUCED_BY (Alice),\n  INPUT_VERIFIED (Bob)\n}"]
        Y["claims['Y'] = {\n  DERIVED_FROM (Carol),\n  ATTESTED:model (Dave),\n  ATTESTED:infra (Eve)\n}"]
    end
    
    ALICE --> X
    BOB --> X
    CAROL --> Y
    DAVE --> Y
    EVE --> Y
```

### Verification Algorithm

```python
def verify_multi_party(artifact_id, trust_policy):
    # 1. Collect all claims about this artifact
    claims = collect_claims_by_subject(artifact_id)
    
    # 2. Verify each claim's signature independently
    for claim in claims:
        verify_signature(claim, claim.signer)
        verify_signer_trusted(claim.signer, trust_policy)
    
    # 3. Recurse into referenced artifacts (DAG traversal)
    for input_ref in get_input_references(claims):
        verify_multi_party(input_ref.artifact_id, trust_policy)
    
    # 4. Check claim completeness per level
    assert has_required_claims(claims, artifact.maturity_level)
    
    # 5. Evaluate cross-claim consistency
    assert claims_consistent(claims)
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use When |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **FAIL** | Any conflict fails verification | High-security environments |
| **QUORUM** | Majority of trusted parties wins | Distributed trust |
| **PRIORITY** | Higher trust level wins | Hierarchical trust |
| **TEMPORAL** | Most recent claim wins | Evolving state |
